ABDOMINAL CT:  Abdominal CT showed 14 lesions of T10 and sacrum most likely secondary to osteoporosis. These can be followed by repeat imaging as an outpatient.

Compared adults, AP might disappear several months after birth and recur later in life. Perry et al. reported 140 children with symptomatic WPW syndrome who developed tachycardia as early as 0-2 months after birth, and 93% of their symptoms disappeared. However, 31% experienced recurrence at 12 years of age.15 The Taiwan National Health Insurance Program provided information on pediatric WPW syndrome and RFCA therapy to researchers. Between 2000 and 2014, the incidence of WPW syndrome was 0.17/1000 patient-years in those born between 2000 and 2008, of whom 28% were diagnosed by 1 year of age and 50% by 6 years of age. The cumulative percentage of RFCA in WPW syndrome was 1.7% in infancy, 5.8% before 5 years of age, and 31.8% before 10 years of age. Patients with WPW syndrome may undergo ablation at a younger age due to a high risk of sudden death if WPW syndrome is combined with other cardiac problems in children, not developing atrial fibrillation or cardiac death.16 In addition, unlike Brugada syndrome, patients with WPW syndrome are less likely to experience sudden death when AV reentry tachycardia occurs.17

Relationship of locations between symptomatic and non-symptomatic pediatric WPW patients In this study, all of the patients had tachycardia, and more patient had right-side than left-side APs (R:L = 70:34). Poppone et al. studied 152 patients with asymptomatic WPW syndrome who were under 12 years of age, and reported that more patients had left-side than right-side APs (L:R = 87:65).18 The results suggest that right-side APs may trigger tachycardia more easily than left-side APs during childhood.
