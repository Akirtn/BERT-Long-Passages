HEAD CT:  Head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect, but old infarction consistent with past medical history.

ABDOMINAL CT:  Abdominal CT showed 14 lesions of T10 and sacrum most likely secondary to osteoporosis. These can be followed by repeat imaging as an outpatient.

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  Radiologic studies also included four chest CTs, which confirmed cavitary lesions in the left lung apex consistent with infectious process/tuberculosis.  This also moderate-sized left pleural effusion.
